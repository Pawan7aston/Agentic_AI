What ReAct ?

ReAct is an agent design that interleaves Actions (tool calls, environment interactions) with Reasoning (internal chain-of-thought) and Observations (tool/environment feedback) so the agent can plan, act, inspect results, and update plans in a loop.
Loop mapped to your steps

1.ACT — the agent issues an action (e.g., call a tool, make an API request, run a function, or produce a query).

2.OBSERVE — the agent receives the result or feedback from that action (tool output, environment state).

3.REASON — the agent processes the observation, updates its internal chain-of-thought / beliefs, decides next actions or terminates.

Example (web-search assistant)

ACT → call search("latest model benchmarks X")
OBSERVE → receive search results snippet list
REASON → extract facts, identify missing info → ACT (call specific paper URL or summarizer) → OBSERVE → REASON → return answer


Why interleaving ACT/OBSERVE/REASON helps

Efficient: only queries tools when necessary (reduces cost & latency).
Robust: uses observations to recover from incorrect assumptions.
Transparent: internal reasoning traces help debugging and auditability.


When to use ReAct

Tool-augmented assistants (search, DB, code-execution, calculators).
Tasks requiring multi-step verification or dynamic interaction with external systems.
Environments where actions produce noisy/partial feedback.
