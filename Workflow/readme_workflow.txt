- Prompt chaining is the process of sending multiple prompts to a language model in a specific order, often using 
the previous outputs to inform the next prompt. It allows you to decompose complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

===================================================

Why Use Prompt Chaining?

1.Break down complex reasoning: Large tasks like summarizing, generating SQL, or multi-step reasoning can be done step by step.
2.Context reuse: Earlier responses can provide context for later prompts.
3.Tool orchestration: You can combine LLM output with external tools or APIs in a controlled sequence.
4.Better accuracy: Step-by-step processing reduces hallucinations or errors compared to a single large prompt.
